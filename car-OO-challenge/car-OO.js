// Part 1: Create a class for vehicle. Each vehicle instance should have the following properties:

// - make
// - model
// - year
// Each vehicle instance should have access to a method called ***honk***, which returns the string “Beep.”

class Vehicle {
  constructor(a, b, c) {
    this.make = a;
    this.model = b;
    this.year = c;
  }
  honk() {
    return "Beep";
  }
  toString() {
    return `The vehicle is a ${this.make} ${this.model} from ${this.year}.`;
  }
}

let myFirstVehicle = new Vehicle("Honda", "Monster Truck", 1999);
myFirstVehicle.honk(); // "Beep."
myFirstVehicle.toString(); // "The vehicle is a Honda Monster Truck from 1999."

// Part 2: Create a class for a car. The Car class should inherit from Vehicle and each car instance should have a property called numWheels which has a value of 4.

class Car extends Vehicle {
  constructor(a, b, c) {
    super(a, b, c);
    this.numWheels = 4;
  }
}
let myFirstCar = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2005);
myFirstCar.toString(); // "The vehicle is a Toyota Corolla from 2005."
myFirstCar.honk(); // "Beep."
myFirstCar.numWheels; // 4

// Part 3: Create a class for a Motorcycle. This class should inherit from Vehicle and each motorcycle instance should have a property called numWheels which has a value of 2. It should also have a revEngine method which returns “VROOM!!!”

class Motorcycle extends Vehicle {
  constructor(a, b, c) {
    super(a, b, c);
    this.numWheels = 2;
  }
  revEngine() {
    return "VROOM!!!";
  }
}

let myFirstMotorcycle = new Motorcycle("Honda", "Nighthawk", 2000);

myFirstMotorcycle.toString();
// "The vehicle is a Honda Nighthawk from 2000."

myFirstMotorcycle.honk(); // "Beep."
myFirstMotorcycle.revEngine(); // "VROOM!!!"
myFirstMotorcycle.numWheels; // 2

// Part 4: Create a class for a Garage. It should have a property called ***vehicles*** which will store an array of vehicles, and a property called ***capacity*** which is a number indicating how many vehicles will fit in the garage. When you create a garage, ***vehicles*** will always be empty; you only need to provide the ***capacity***.

// A garage should also have an ***add*** method, which attempts to add a vehicle to the array of vehicles. However, if you try to add something which is *not* a vehicle, the garage should return the message “Only vehicles are allowed in here!”. Also, if the garage is at capacity, it should say “Sorry, we’re full.”

class Garage {
  constructor(e) {
    this.vehicles = [];
    this.capacity = e;
  }
  add(newVehicle) {
    if (!(newVehicle instanceof Vehicle)) {
      return "Only vehicles are allowed in here!";
    }
    if (this.vehicles.length >= this.capacity) {
      return "Sorry, we're full.";
    }
    this.vehicles.push(newVehicle);
    return "Vehicle added!";
  }
}

let garage = new Garage(2);
garage.vehicles; // []
garage.add(new Car("Hyundai", "Elantra", 2015)); // "Vehicle added!"
garage.vehicles; // [Car]
garage.add("Taco"); // "Only vehicles are allowed in here!"

garage.add(new Motorcycle("Honda", "Nighthawk", 2000));
// "Vehicle added!"
garage.vehicles; // [Car, Motorcycle]

garage.add(new Motorcycle("Honda", "Nighthawk", 2001));
// "Sorry, we're full."
